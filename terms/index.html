          <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <p>
            By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
            apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
            carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify
            the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re
            not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
            you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or
            make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
            copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to Simon LEFORT, also known as
            &quot;Androz2091&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simon LEFORT, also known as &quot;Androz2091&quot; is committed to
            ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
            that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to
            charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
            never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
            clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dumpus app stores and processes personal data that you have
            provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to
            keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process
            of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
            official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
            vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
            phone’s security features and it could mean that the Dumpus app
            won’t work properly or at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and
            Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that Simon LEFORT,
            also known as &quot;Androz2091&quot; will not take responsibility
            for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
            active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
            by your mobile network provider, but Simon LEFORT, also known as
            &quot;Androz2091&quot; cannot take responsibility for the app not
            working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
            you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
            using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
            including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your
            home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the same lines, Simon LEFORT, also known as
            &quot;Androz2091&quot; cannot always take responsibility for the way
            you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays
            charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
            avail the Service, Simon LEFORT, also known as
            &quot;Androz2091&quot; cannot accept responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to Simon LEFORT, also known as &quot;Androz2091&quot;’s
            responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
            it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure
            that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third
            parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
            available to you. Simon LEFORT, also known as &quot;Androz2091&quot;
            accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
            experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
            the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
            available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both
            systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
            availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
            the updates if you want to keep using the app. Simon LEFORT, also
            known as &quot;Androz2091&quot; does not promise that it will always
            update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
            Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.
            However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
            when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and
            may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
            termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>
